GNUPLOT has been tested on a Pyramid 90x (ucb 4.2 and att V),
a VAX 8200 (VMS 4.3), IBM PC's and AT's (MS-DOS 3.1, Microsoft C 4.0).
The code is written with portability in mind, and it passes lint!
If you have problems, send mail to vu-vlsi!plot.  And please send
any modifications you make so they can be #ifdef'd into later releases.

These #defines should be checked before compilation:

VFORK       Makefile        define if you've got vfork() system call
vms         Makefile        define if compiling under VMS;
                              automatically defined by DEC C
PC          Makefile        define if compiling on a PClone
MSDOS       Makefile        define if compiling under MSDOS;
                              automatically defined by Microsoft C 4.0
AED         Makefile        define these if you want this terminal driver
HP75           .              included
QMS            .
REGIS          .
TEK            .
UNIXPLOT       .

CGA            .            same, but only if PC is defined
CORONA         .
EGA            .

HUGE        plot.h          define to be largest double if not defined
                              in <math.h>
HELP        plot.h          program run by 'help' command
SHELL       plot.h          default shell to spawn if SHELL environment
                              variable not found at run-time

To compile:

under UNIX:  type 'make'

under VMS:  type '@compile', then '@link'.  Use the 'vmshelp.csh' script
to convert the help files.  If you don't have access to a Unix machine,
send us mail and we'll send you the VMS GNUPLOT.HLB.

under MSDOS:  use 'make make.msc' for Microsoft C 4.0.  If you've got
another compiler, you're on your own!
