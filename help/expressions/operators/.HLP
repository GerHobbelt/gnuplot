The operators in GNUPLOT are the same as the corresponding operators
in the C programming language, except that all operators accept integer, real,
and complex arguments, unless otherwise noted.  The FORTRAN **
(exponentiation) operator is also supported.

Parentheses may be used to change order of evaluation.
