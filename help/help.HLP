The 'help' command will display on-line help.  To specify information
on a particular topic use the syntax:

    help <topic>

You may exit the help utility and return to the plot program
by either pressing <return> at the 'Topic?' prompt or pressing your
computer's END-OF-FILE character at any help prompt.
